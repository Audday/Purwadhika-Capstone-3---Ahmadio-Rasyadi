# Travel Insurance Classification - Capstone Project 3
# **Business Understanding**

*Context*

Travel insurance is a type of insurance that provides protection as long as we travel both domestically and abroad. Several countries have even required travelers to have travel insurance, for example, countries in Europe and America. The amount of premium depends on the coverage desired, the length of the trip, and the purpose of the trip. A company engaged in travel insurance wants to know the policyholder who will submit an insurance claim for coverage. Policyholder data at insurance companies is historical data consisting of destinations, insurance products, and so on.

Target :

0: Did not submit insurance claim

1: Submit Insurance Claim

## Problem Statement
Processing insurance claims is a resource-intensive task. The company wants to improve its operational efficiency by identifying which customers are most likely to submit claims. This will allow them to allocate resources more effectively and manage risk more efficiently.

Additionally, understanding the factors that contribute to a customer's likelihood of submitting a claim will enable the company to tailor its insurance products and services better, potentially reducing the number of claims or managing them more effectively.

## Goals
The goal is to develop a predictive model that can classify whether a policyholder is likely to submit an insurance claim based on historical data. This model will help the company focus its resources on high-risk customers, optimize premium pricing, and enhance customer service.

Furthermore, the company seeks to understand the key factors that influence a customer's decision to submit a claim. This knowledge will allow the company to make informed decisions about product offerings, customer engagement strategies, and risk management.

## Analytic Approach
To address the business problem, the following steps will be taken:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the historical data to identify patterns and trends that distinguish customers who submit claims from those who do not.
- Feature Engineering: Identify and create features that are most predictive of a customer's likelihood to submit a claim.
- Model Building: Develop a classification model to predict the probability of a customer submitting an insurance claim.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as ROC-AUC, Precision, and Recall to ensure that the model balances the - trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

## Final Goal
The final goal is to implement a classification model that helps the company efficiently predict and manage claims while also gaining insights into the key factors driving these claims. This will enable the company to reduce costs, improve risk management, and offer better-targeted insurance products to its customers.
